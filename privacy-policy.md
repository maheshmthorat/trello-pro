# Privacy Policy for Trello Pro

Trello Pro does **not collect**, **store**, or **share** any personal data.

- The extension runs entirely in your browser.
- No information is sent to external servers.
- No user-identifiable data is accessed or tracked.
- All settings are stored locally using Chrome's `storage.sync` feature.

This extension only enhances your Trello experience by modifying the page UI with features like card counters and UI cleanup. We value your privacy and aim to keep everything fully transparent and secure.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact the developer at [maheshthorat.web.app](https://maheshthorat.web.app).
